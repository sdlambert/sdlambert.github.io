##About me

Hi there! scott/dev is my personal web development blog, and the place you'll find all of my [portfolio items](/portfolio/) and [posts](/blog/) about all things web dev.

###Vitals

I'm currently a student at [Macomb Community College](http://macomb.edu) and enrolled in the IT Department's [Website Programming program](http://www.macomb.edu/future-students/choose-program/information-technology-website-programming/index.html). I plan on completing my Associate of Applied Science degree in the winter of 2016.

Interested in my work history or a formal resume? Check out my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdlamber). You might also want to check out my [GitHub repos](https://www.github.com/sdlambert), [experiments on CodePen](http://codepen.io/sdlambert), or [my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/sdlamber).

###Focus

One of the things I've developed over my career is a commitment to continuous improvement. I'm always looking at ways to improve, use new tools, and approach problems with a different perspective. My goal is to bring this expertise to the things I do and write about here. To complement this I've developed a strong interest in standardization and best practices. While the web development world evolves, I'll be keeping these two areas in the forefront.
