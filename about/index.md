## Studies

I'm currently a student at [Macomb Community College](http://macomb.edu) and enrolled in the IT Department's [Website Programming degree program](http://www.macomb.edu/future-students/choose-program/information-technology-website-programming/index.html). I plan on completing my Associate of Applied Science degree in the winter of 2016. The areas of front-end development I enjoy the most are working with Javascript, AJAX and the DOM. In addition, I am constantly looking at how I can adapt best practices for CSS into my projects.

## Expertise

One of my key strengths is a commitment to continuous improvement. I am constantly searching for new problems to solve, from tweaking a customer service model to improving the way we gather metrics. To complement this, I've developed a strong interest in standardization, documentation and best practices. In addition to solving problems in the business realm, it is important to focus inwards as well, and gaining new skills is an important part of who I am.

I've learned the power of leveraging teamwork and collaboration and the value of clear communication. I have also developed a strong attention to detail and demonstrated the ability to apply this to multiple, simultaneous tasks. Through my work experience I have applied Six Sigma methodologies to problem solving and used them to acheive significant and measurable results.

I strive to bring the same level of passion and expertise to all of the things I learn and write about here.
