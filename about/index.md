##Studies

I'm currently a student at [Macomb Community College](http://macomb.edu) and enrolled in the IT Department's [Website Programming program](http://www.macomb.edu/future-students/choose-program/information-technology-website-programming/index.html). I plan on completing my Associate of Applied Science degree in the winter of 2016.

##Expertise

One of things I bring to any project is a commitment to continuous improvement. I'm always looking at ways to get better, use new tools, and approach problems with a different perspective. To complement this I've also developed a strong interest in standardization and best practices. I like finding the best tool for the job. I strive to bring the same level of passion to the things I learn and write about here.
