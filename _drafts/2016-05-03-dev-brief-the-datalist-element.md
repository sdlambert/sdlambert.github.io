The `<datalist>` element is an HTML5 element that provides a list of suggested values for an input element. In this brief article, we'll explore the usage of the element and look at some use cases, and discuss the browser support (or lack thereof) and how we can use the feature today using polyfills.

##The Element

If you are anything like me, you might not know the first thing about the `datalist` element. I was perusing a demo of HTML5 input elements and it caught my eye. I had never heard of it, or, at the very least, had failed to recall it. I pulled out my "Intro to HTML" textbook, and indeed, there was two pages dedicated to it in my book.

The `<datalist>` is pretty straightforward in and of itself, and borrows the `option` element from it's more popular cousin, the `select` element.
